# University-Math

This Repository was put together for the common goal of creating a collective Math repository. Some of the Math below was required for completing a 3-year 
BSc in Computer Science at my University . Each `folder` is labelled by topic. See the below tree diagram to help navigate the repository.

Content will still be missing and therefore I have incorparated external work, exams and tests. The  Math `Problems` folders will have Exams, tests or small problems to solve. Solutions are given too.
